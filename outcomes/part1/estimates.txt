RTO : Recovery Time Objective
The targeted amount of time for a recovery to complete in the event of failure.

RPO : Recovery Point Objective
The targeted amount of time during which data is at risk for loss in the event of a failure.

Following two features of the configuration have impact on both RTO and RPO.
Multi-AZ:
1. Replication:
    1. Is synchronous.
    2. Write only succeeds when written to both EBS volumes.
2. Failover is automatic and transparent applications.
3. Addresses availability.

Cross Region:
1. Replication:
    1. Is asynchronous.
    2. Replication lag depends on:
         1. Network latency between source and destination region
         2. Amount of traffic replicated
2. Failover is user/script initiated.
3. Addresses DR.

Now with information we can try to address RTO and RPO.
1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage:
Typically automatic failover completes in one or two minutes.
Failover can be affected by large uncommitted transactions.
These must be recovered for failover to complete. In this case failover may take more time.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage:
As this is driven manually/configured scripts. Depends on following factors:
1. Detecting region outage
2. Promoting Read replica
3. Application config changes if applicable

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage:
As replication is synchronous, RPO is zero.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage:
As replication is asynchronous, its impacted by replica lag.
Following command can give exact lag:
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <db-id> | grep LatestRestorableTime
